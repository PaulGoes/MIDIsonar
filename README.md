## An Arduino based MIDI Gesture Controller 
The MidiSonar is a MIDI Gesture Controller based on an Arduino UNO with two HC-SR04 sonar sensors.

With MIDIsonar you have ***two independent sonar based gesture controllers*** that let you create music by waving your hands up and down above the controllers.

Each gesture controller uses a sonar sensor that measures the distance between itself and the hand above it using sonar waves (much like bats do to orientate themselves). 

By varying the distance between your hands and the sonar sensors you ***generate musical information*** that can be send over the MIDI Out to any MIDI capable device like your synthesizer, drum machine or DAW.

MIDISonar lets you generate the following MIDI information:

- **MIDI Control Changes - Change the sound characteristics:**
    - Selectable MIDI CC number
    - Selectable value range (min and max)
- **MIDI Notes - Play melodies and scales:**
    - Selectable root note
    - Selectable scale
      - Chromatic
      - Major
      - Minor
      - Melodic Minor
      - Harmonic Minor
      - Whole Tone
      - Major Blues
      - Minor Blues
      - Major Pentatonic
      - Minor Pentatonic
      - Octatonic Whole Half
      - Octatonic Half Whole
- **MIDI Chords - Play harmonies and progressions:**
    - Selectable root note
    - Selectable chord progression
      - Major
      - Minor
      - Major Blues 7th
      - Minor Blues 7th
      - Pop
      - Jazz
      - Modal
      - Gospel
      - Pachelbel  
- **MIDI Pitchbend - Change the tone height of the sound:**
    - Selectable direction (up, down, up&down)
    - Selectable value range (min and max) and neutral zone
